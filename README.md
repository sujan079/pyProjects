**#As for the chat bot **


Certainly! Here's a short README for the provided Python chatbot:

Simple Chatbot
This Python script implements a basic chatbot that interacts with users by answering questions based on a pre-defined knowledge base and learns from user input to enhance its knowledge.

Features
Knowledge Base: The chatbot uses a JSON file (knowledge_base.json) to store questions and their corresponding answers.
Interactive Learning: When the chatbot doesn't know the answer to a question, it prompts the user to teach it by providing the answer.
Matching Algorithm: It uses a fuzzy matching algorithm to find the closest question match from the knowledge base.
Usage
Run the Python script (chatbot.py).
Enter your query or question when prompted by the bot.
The chatbot will attempt to answer based on its existing knowledge.
If the bot doesn't know the answer, it will ask for your help to provide the answer.
To exit the chatbot, type 'quit'.
Setup
Ensure you have Python installed.

File Description
chatbot.py: The main Python script containing the chatbot logic.
knowledge_base.json: JSON file storing questions and answers for the chatbot.
Note
Use 'quit' to exit the chatbot.
